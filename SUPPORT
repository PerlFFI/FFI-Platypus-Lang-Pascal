SUPPORT

    If something does not work as advertised, or the way that you think it
    should, or if you have a feature request, please open an issue on this
    project's GitHub issue tracker:

    https://github.com/PerlFFI/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Pascal/issues

    This project's GitHub issue tracker listed above is not Write-Only. If
    you want to contribute then feel free to browse through the existing
    issues and see if there is something you feel you might be good at and
    take a whack at the problem. I frequently open issues myself that I
    hope will be accomplished by someone in the future but do not have time
    to immediately implement myself.

    Another good area to help out in is documentation. I try to make sure
    that there is good document coverage, that is there should be
    documentation describing all the public features and warnings about
    common pitfalls, but an outsider's or alternate view point on such
    things would be welcome; if you see something confusing or lacks
    sufficient detail I encourage documentation only pull requests to
    improve things.
